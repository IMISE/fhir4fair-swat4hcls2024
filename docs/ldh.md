# Local Data Hubs with FAIRDOM SEEK
A [Local Data Hub](https://www.nfdi4health.de/en/service/local-data-hub.html) is a concept developed by [NFDI4Health](https://www.nfdi4health.de/en/) to support FAIR data preservation and sharing in the domain of personal health data.

Its basic component is the Research Data Management [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/), an open source web-based cataloging and commons platform, for sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets. SEEK utilizes the [ISA model](https://isa-tools.org/), a standard framework for describing how individual experiments are aggregated into wider studies and investigations. 

## Tutorial sandbox
A [sandbox](https://sandbox1.fairdomhub.org/) is temporarely provided with a draft implementation of a FHIR export for SEEK Investigation and SEEK Study.
